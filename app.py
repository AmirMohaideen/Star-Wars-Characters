He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. He could actually save save people from death? The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him? He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself. - Revenge of the Sith"
